# What it is
The game is similar to a classic snake game, and it's called "Spelling Bee". The point is to collect the letters for the given word, being careful not to accidentally hit the walls or itself. There is a 60 second timer for each level, and the goal is to collect as many words as possible. Each time a word is collected, the speed increases slightly to increase the difficulty. The levels progress to have more letters in the words, so that the game becomes more difficult. I decided to only have 3 levels, as I feel like the game becomes a bit repetitive after that :)

# Why/ how I made it
I made the game to test my newfound JS and CSS knowledge, and to make an entertaining, playable game so that people can play it and enjoy it in their freetime. I made the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to add moving elements and styling, as well as allowing a playable link by the end. This is my first independent JS project, without a tutorial to guide me!

# What I struggled with and what I learned

I struggled with many parts of the code, especially since I have never made a game like this before properly, so I had to learn many new functions/ commands. I usually use python while coding, so another thing I struggled with was the differences between the different languages and the commands. However, I learned many things, such as the use of CSS to create visual elements, and using sounds and moving parts in JavaScript to create a functional game :)
